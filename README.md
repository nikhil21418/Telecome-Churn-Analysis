# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains the resources and description for a comprehensive analysis of customer churn within the telecom industry, performed using **Microsoft Power BI**. The primary goal was to conduct thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key factors influencing customer attrition and to visualize these findings in an interactive dashboard.

## üéØ Objectives

* Analyze a telecom customer dataset to understand the characteristics of customers who churn versus those who stay.
* Perform detailed EDA to uncover patterns related to demographics, tenure, contract types, services subscribed, charges, and payment methods.
* Identify the key drivers and indicators of customer churn.
* Develop an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to visualize the findings and enable data-driven decision-making for retention strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Microsoft Power BI:**
    * **Power Query:** For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
    * **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** (Optional: Mention if you used complex measures) For creating calculated measures and columns.
    * **Power BI Desktop:** For dashboard development and visualization.

## üìà Key Analysis & Visualizations

The EDA and dashboard focus on answering questions like:

* What is the overall churn rate?
* How does churn vary by customer demographics (gender, partner status, dependents)?
* What is the relationship between customer tenure and churn?
* Which contract types (Month-to-month, One year, Two year) have the highest churn rates?
* How do different services (Phone, Internet, Streaming, etc.) impact churn?
* Is there a correlation between monthly/total charges and churn?
* Which payment methods are more common among churned customers?

## üí° Insights & Conclusion

*(Summarize the main findings from your EDA. For example:)*

* Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to those on yearly contracts.
* Lower tenure customers are more likely to churn.
* Higher monthly charges seem correlated with increased churn, especially for specific service combinations.

This analysis provides a clear picture of churn dynamics, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention.
